                    For lead generation, we have a unique marketing program that generates houses for us to buy before
                    they hit the open market. We work regularly with Wholesalers, Brokers and Top Real Estate agents,
                    and target distressed as well as REO Properties. This lead generation marketing program drives the
                    necessary incoming phone calls and emails to be able to “cherry pick” the houses we really want and
                    the ones that are most profitable.

                <p class="para-lg">
                    Once a viable house lead is generated, each property is fully vetted both physically and financially
                    to determine viability in producing profit. The vetting process includes the following:

                    <strong>Location and Comp Analysis:</strong><br>
                    Comps are pulled and sold houses are reviewed to gather a range that this house can be sold. To pull
                    comps and gather location analysis, we use local top sales agents and data services to generate a
                    report on subject property. We also review crime statistics in the area, drive the property various
                    times of the day and view the overall general nature of the area.

                    <strong>Current Condition of Property:</strong><br>
                    An analysis on the condition of the home is completed which may include plumbing inspections,
                    roofing inspections, foundation inspections. As needed, appraisals’ or BPOs are completed prior to
                    purchasing the home.

                    <strong>Cost of Acquisition:</strong><br>
                    Nationwide uses templates that determine the costs of acquisition which include closing costs,
                    insurance fees, property price and other misc expenses such as plumbing inspections (if needed). Our
                    target ARV is 60 – 70%.

                    <strong>Cost of Repairs:</strong><br>
                    Nationwide uses templates that calculate the costs of repairs. This includes all known costs on
                    current projects down to the dollar per sq/ft. for labor and materials.
